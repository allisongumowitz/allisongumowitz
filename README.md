# **Hello! 👋**

Hi! My name is Allison Gumowitz. I am a Junior at Florida Atlantic University pursuing my BA in Computer Science with both a minor in Artifical Intelligence and Cybersecurity!
I am excited to continue building my technical skills through many fun self-projects and class assingments that will be available below. Effective communication and orginization are my strong skills, as well as
my drive to understand new topics and learn from others.
